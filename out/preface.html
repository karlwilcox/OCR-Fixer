<h1>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h1>


' It is the aim of this Volume to inquire into the true charac-
ter and right office of Heraldiy, and to describe and illustrate
its general condition as it is in use amongst ourselves.

Of the rise and progress of Heraldry, and of its almost uni-
versal prevalence under variously modified forms, I have not
attempted to give more than a slight and rapid sketch. I have
been content also to refer only incidentally and in a few words
to the value and interest of Heraldry, as a handmaid of History^
as an ally of Art, and as the chronicler of Archaeology â€” my
purpose being not so much to lead students on to the applica-
tion of Heraldry, as to enable them to apply it by becoming
Heralds. In the following pages, accordingly, I have sought
to define and elucidate the principles of Heraldry, to exemplify
its practice, and to illustrate at once its utility and its attrac-
tiveness. The Heraldry of the present time I have desired
uniformly to exhibit as the direct descendant and the living
representative of the Heraldxy of the past ; and the student
will observe that I have systematically endeavoured to impress
APPENDED DATA
him with the conviction that Heraldry is, essentially and at
all times, inseparably associated with History, or at any rate
with Biography.



This Volume does not profess to extend its range to legendary
Heraldry, nor does it include even references to those fiftnciful
and often fantastic speculations, in which the early Heralds
delighted to indulge.  The Curiosities of Heraldry in like
manner, it leaves, with grateful and admiring acknowledgment,
in the accomplished hands of Mr. Mark Anthony Lower. Re-
peated references to standard works upon Heraldry I have con-
sidered to be neither necessary nor desirable, but instead of
this, I have prepared and inserted a complete list of heraldic
authorities ; and, in the preparation of my pages I have been
scrupulously careful that every statement contained in them
should be based upon certain and approved authority.

Historical Heraldry occupies a position of such importance
in Histories of England, that a certain amount of heraldic
knowledge has become indispensable to the student of English
History.

Every Gk)thic Architect ought to be a thorough Herald.
Heraldiy alone can enable him to render his works, in the 

noblest and most perfect sense, historic moniunents. Without
Heraldry, no lover of the great Art, which has been so happily
revived amongst us, is able either to feel the full power of
what the Gothic has transmitted to him from the olden time,
or to realise all that it is now able to accomplish as a living
art.

Historical Painters, having at length learned to estimate
aright the worth of archaeological accuracy, constantly re-
quire that information which Heraldry is ever ready to
impart.

It is the same with Sculptors, when they treat of subjects
that are derived from either medisBval or modem History,
or that are in any way associated with Gothic Architec-
ture.

To Illuminators, Heraldry opens a wide and richly diversi-
fied field of attractive study. The beautiful and deservedly
popular Art of Illammation finds in Heraldry a most versatile
and efficient confederate. True Illumination, indeed, is in its
nature heraldic ; and true Heraldry provides for Illuminators
the most appropriate, graphic and effective both of their sub-
jects, and of the details and accessories of their practice.

In some sense or degree also Heraldry enjoys the favour of
the general public. To many persons, as to seal engravers and
herald painters, it provides what may be styled a profession.
Whoever has, or desires to have a  coat-of-arms, professes to
know something about Heraldry ; that is, he is favourably dis-
posed towards it, though perhaps he is unconscious of the
sentiment. It is always pleasant to the pedestrian public,
many of them bearers of time-honoured arms and having the
reddest of red blood flowing in their veins, to be familiar with
the heraldic blazonry that appears upon the panels of aristo-
cratic carriages. Nor is it less satisfactory, when we chance
to see a flag displayed and blowing out in the breeze, or when
our eyes rest upon an heraldic seal, or when we discover a
shield of arms in a book, or on a monument, or amidst the
deconktive accessories of some building, to be able to read what
Heraldiy thus has written with her peculiar symbols. And
then, aja a matter of course. Heraldry, as of old, receives a
becoming homage from the wealthy inheritors of historic names
and noble titles ; while a similar homage is no less cordially
tendered by those whose Heraldry, like their own position in
the great world of society, is at least of comparatively recent
growth.

Prom each and all of these Friends of Heraldry, this Volume
ventures to anticipate a welcome, inasmuch as it inspires to
place before them, in a plain and simple form, whatever
heraldic teaching they may require; and also because, as a
book of reference, they will find it to be trustworthy, easy
to be consulted, and, as far as it professes to go, complete.
