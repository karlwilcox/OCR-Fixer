<h1 data-source-line="180">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h1>
 <p data-source-line="181"> ' It is the aim of this Volume to inquire into the true
 character and right office of Heraldry, and to describe and illustrate its general
 condition as it is in use amongst ourselves.</p>

 <p data-source-line="186"> Of the rise and progress of Heraldry, and of its almost
 universal prevalence under variously modified forms, I have not attempted to give
 more than a slight and rapid sketch. I have been content also to refer only incidentally
 and in a few words to the value and interest of Heraldry, as a handmaid of History
 as an ally of Art, and as the chronicler of Archaeology â€” my purpose being not
 so much to lead students on to the application of Heraldry, as to enable them to
 apply it by becoming Heralds. In the following pages, accordingly, I have sought
 to define and elucidate the principles of Heraldry, to exemplify its practice, and
 to illustrate at once its utility and its attractiveness. The Heraldry of the present
 time I have desired uniformly to exhibit as the direct descendant and the living
 representative of the Heraldxy of the past ; and the student will observe that I
 have systematically endeavoured to impress him with the conviction that Heraldry
 is, essentially and at all times, inseparably associated with History, or at any
 rate with Biography.</p>

 <p data-source-line="209"> This Volume does not profess to extend its range to legendary
 Heraldry, nor does it include even references to those fiftnciful and often fantastic
 speculations, in which the early Heralds delighted to indulge.  The Curiosities of
 Heraldry in like manner, it leaves, with grateful and admiring acknowledgment, in
 the accomplished hands of Mr. Mark Anthony Lower. Repeated references to standard
 works upon Heraldry I have considered to be neither necessary nor desirable, but
 instead of this, I have prepared and inserted a complete list of heraldic authorities
 ; and, in the preparation of my pages I have been scrupulously careful that every
 statement contained in them should be based upon certain and approved authority.</p>


 <p data-source-line="222"> Historical Heraldry occupies a position of such importance
 in Histories of England, that a certain amount of heraldic knowledge has become indispensable
 to the student of English History.</p>

 <p data-source-line="227"> Every Gk)thic Architect ought to be a thorough Herald.
 Heraldry alone can enable him to render his works, in the 
 noblest and most perfect
 sense, historic moniunents. Without Heraldry, no lover of the great Art, which has
 been so happily revived amongst us, is able either to feel the full power of what
 the Gothic has transmitted to him from the olden time, or to realise all that it
 is now able to accomplish as a living art.</p>

 <p data-source-line="236"> Historical Painters, having at length learned to estimate
 aright the worth of archaeological accuracy, constantly require that information
 which Heraldry is ever ready to impart.</p>

 <p data-source-line="241"> It is the same with Sculptors, when they treat of subjects
 that are derived from either mediaeval or modern History, or that are in any way
 associated with Gothic Architecture.</p>

 <p data-source-line="246"> To Illuminators, Heraldry opens a wide and richly diversified
 field of attractive study. The beautiful and deservedly popular Art of Illammation
 finds in Heraldry a most versatile and efficient confederate. True Illumination,
 indeed, is in its nature heraldic ; and true Heraldry provides for Illuminators the
 most appropriate, graphic and effective both of their subjects, and of the details
 and accessories of their practice.</p>

 <p data-source-line="259"> In some sense or degree also Heraldry enjoys the favour
 of the general public. To many persons, as to seal engravers and herald painters,
 it provides what may be styled a profession. Whoever has, or desires to have a  coat-of-arms,
 professes to know something about Heraldry ; that is, he is favourably disposed towards
 it, though perhaps he is unconscious of the sentiment. It is always pleasant to the
 pedestrian public, many of them bearers of time-honoured arms and having the reddest
 of red blood flowing in their veins, to be familiar with the heraldic blazonry that
 appears upon the panels of aristocratic carriages. Nor is it less satisfactory, when
 we chance to see a flag displayed and blowing out in the breeze, or when our eyes
 rest upon an heraldic seal, or when we discover a shield of arms in a book, or on
 a monument, or amidst the deconktive accessories of some building, to be able to
 read what Heraldiy thus has written with her peculiar symbols. And then, aja a matter
 of course. Heraldry, as of old, receives a becoming homage from the wealthy inheritors
 of historic names and noble titles ; while a similar homage is no less cordially
 tendered by those whose Heraldry, like their own position in the great world of society,
 is at least of comparatively recent growth.</p>
