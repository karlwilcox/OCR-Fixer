<h1 data-source-line="1" data-source-file="duke.txt">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h1>

 <p data-source-line="124" data-source-file="duke.txt"> It is the aim of this Volume
 to inquire into the true character and right office of Heraldry, and to describe
 and illustrate its general condition as it is in use amongst ourselves.</p>

 <p data-source-line="128" data-source-file="duke.txt"> Of the rise and progress of
 Heraldry, and of its almost universal prevalence under variously modified forms,
 I have not attempted to give more than a slight and rapid sketch. I have beeu content
 also to refer only incidentally and in a few words to the value and interest of Heraldry,
 as a handmaid of History, as an ally of Art, and as the chronicler of Archaeology
 — my purpose being not so much to lecid students on to the application of Heraldry,
 as to enable them to apply it by becomingHeralds. In the following pages, accordingly,
 I have sought to define and elucidate the principles of Heraldry, to exemplify its
 practice, and to illustrate at once its utility and its attractiveness. The Heraldry
 of the present time I have desired uniformly to exhibit as the direct descendant
 and the living representative of the Heraldry of the past; and the student will observe
 that I have systematically endeavoured to impress him with the conviction that Heraldiy
 is, essentially and at all times, inseparably associated with History, or at any
 rate with Biography.</p>

 <p data-source-line="153" data-source-file="duke.txt"> This Volume does not profess
 to extend its range to legendaryHeraldry, nor does it include even references to
 those fanciful and often fantastic speculations, in wliich the early Heralds delighted
 to indulge. The " Curiosities of Heraldry " in like manner, it leaves, with grateful
 and admiring acknowledgment, in the accomplished hands of Mr. Mark Anthony Lower.
 Repeated references to standard works upon Heraldry I have considered to be neither
 necessary nor desirable, but instead of this, I have prepared and inserted a complete
 list of heraldic authorities; and in the preparation of my pages I have been scrupulously
 careful that every statement contained in them should be based upon certain and approved
 authority.</p>

 <p data-source-line="166" data-source-file="duke.txt"> Historical Heraldry occupies
 a position of such importance in Histories of England, that a certain amount of heraldic
 knowledge has become indispensable to the student of English History.</p>

 <p data-source-line="171" data-source-file="duke.txt"> Every Gothic Architect oxight
 to be a thorough Herald. Heraldry alone can enable him to render his works, in the
 noblest and most perfect sense, historic monuments, without Heraldry, no lover of
 the great Art, which has been so happily revived amongst us, is able either to feel
 the full power of what the Gothic has transmitted to him from the olden time, or
 to realize all that it is now able to accomplish as a living Art.</p>

 <p data-source-line="180" data-source-file="duke.txt"> Historical Painters, having
 at length learned to estimate aright the worth of archaeological accuracy, constantly
 require that information which Heraldry is ever ready to impart.</p>

 <p data-source-line="185" data-source-file="duke.txt"> It is the same with Sculptors,
 when they treat of subjects that are derived from either mediaeval or modern History,
 or that are in any way associated with Gothic Architecture.</p>

 <p data-source-line="190" data-source-file="duke.txt"> To Illuminators, Heraldry
 opens a wide and richly diversified field of attractive study. The beautiful and
 deservedly popular Art of Illumination finds in Heraldry a most versatile and efficient
 confederate. True Illumination, indeed, is in its nature heraldic; and true Heraldry
 provides for Illuminators the most appropriate, graphic, and effective, both of their
 subjects and of the details and accessories of their practice.</p>

 <p data-source-line="203" data-source-file="duke.txt"> In some sense or degree, also,
 Heraldry enjoys the favour of the general public. To many persons, as to seal engravers
 and herald painters, it provides what may be styled a profession. Whoever has, or
 desii'es to have, a " coat-of-arms," professes to know something about Heraldry ;
 that is, he is favourably disposed towards it, though perhaps he is unconscious of
 the sentiment. It is always pleasant to the pedestrian public — many of them bearers
 of time-honoured arms and having the reddest of red blood flowing in their veins
 — to be familiar with the heraldic blazoniy that appears upon the panels of aristocratic
 carriages. Nor is it less satisfactory, when we chance to see a flag displayed and
 blowing out in the breeze, or when our eyes rest upon an heraldic seal, or when we
 discover a shield of aims in a book, or on a monument, or amidst the decorative accessories
 of some building, to be able to read what Heraldry thus has written with her peculiar
 symbols. And then, as a matter of course. Heraldry, as of old, receives a becoming
 homage from the wealthy inheritors of historic names and noble titles; while a similar
 homage is no less cordially tendered by those whose Heraldry, like their own position
 in the great world of society, is at least of comparatively recent growth.</p>

<h1 data-source-line="232" data-source-file="duke.txt">PREFACE THE SECOND AND THIRD EDITIONS.</h1>

 <p data-source-line="226" data-source-file="duke.txt"> From each and all of these
 Friends of Heraldry, this Volume ventures to anticipate a welcome, inasmuch as it
 aspires to place before them, in a plain and simple form, whatever heraldic teaching
 they may require; and also because, as a book of reference, they will find it to
 be trustworthy, easy to be consulted, and, as far as it professes to go, complete.</p>


 <p data-source-line="247" data-source-file="duke.txt"> If ever I had indulged the
 hope that a Second Edition of this work might be required, I certainly had not contemplated
 the realization of any such speculation without an interval of several years between
 the publication of the First Edition and the appearance of its successor. My surprise,
 accordingly, was as great as my gratification, when I found myself called upon by
 my original publishers, before my First Edition had been published two months, to
 prepare for them a Second Edition with all possible speed.</p>

 <p data-source-line="257" data-source-file="duke.txt"> The corrections and additions
 that I was anxious to make, so far as I was enabled to accomplish them at all, were
 made while my Second Edition was actually passing through the press. Materials in
 abundance were ready at hand ; and indeed the cordial generosity with which the most
 valuable assistance, often unasked, has constantly been placed at my disposal, I
 am altogether unable adequately to acknowledge. From such great kindness, coupled
 with the very gratifying reception that my " Heraldry " has experienced, I venture
 to infer that my Volume, however imperfectly executed, has been conceived in the
 right spirit. Whatever errors and omissions in tho First Edition had been brought
 to my notice, it was my endeavour in the Second Edition to correct and supply : at
 the same time, I was constrained to withhold various additions that had been suggested
 to me, in consequence of being unable to extend my volume beyond certain prescribed
 limits. Whatever fresh matter was introduced, was carefully kept in conformity with
 my original plan, and in itself it was what I hoped would prove to be both useful
 and attractive to students of Historical Heraldry. The Chapter on " Marshalling "
 was considerably extended ; and two Chapters instead of a single one were assigned
 to " Cadency :" the number of the Chapters, however, remained the same, since two
 very short Chapters of the Fii'st Edition were united together. The Illustrations
 in the Second Edition received numerous important additions.</p>

 <p data-source-line="289" data-source-file="duke.txt"> About a year after the first
 appearance of this work, the Second Edition was exhausted, and at the same time the
 copyright passed from the hands of Messrs. Winsor and Newton to those of Mr. Bentley,
 the eminent publisher of New Burlington Street. This Third Edition, now published
 by Mr. Bentley, I have most carefully revised and corrected tliroughout; and it has
 received many additions of the greatest importance. To all points connected with
 heraldic rule, authority and early usage, I have directed my special attention. The
 Chapters previously entitled " Marshalling " and " Cadency," now appear, enlarged
 and rearranged, severally bearing the following titles — " Marshalling and Inheritance,"
 and " Cadency and Differencing." Chapter XVI. has been devoted exclusively to " Royal
 Cadency," which has been treated in it in as systematic a manner as possible. The
 Chapter on the " Royal Heraldry of England " has been in part re-written ; and the
 Chapter on " Foreign Heraldry " has been considerably extended.</p>

 <p data-source-line="307" data-source-file="duke.txt"> Again I have introoduced several
 fresh Illustrations. They consist of twenty-four additional wood-cuts, printed with
 the text; and four lithographic Plates, numbered LXXIX., LXXX., LXXXI., LXXXII.,
 and containing twelve examples : thus, my Illustrations, in all, now number upwards
 of nine hundred and seventy examples. Plate LXXIX., engraved from a photograph of
 the original slab, which several years ago was brought from Venice to England, will
 be regarded with much interest, both from its peculiar heraldic character, and from
 the singular circumstances connected with its recent history and also from the no
 less singular manner in which it was assigned to the individual— one of two great
 rivals, whose armorial insignia it does not display.</p>

 <p data-source-line="326" data-source-file="duke.txt"> I greatly regret to have been
 obliged again to reprint my original lithographs without any alteration in the numbering;
 and also, as in the Second Edition, to intersperse the additional Plates amongst
 those that were before engraved. Thus, in the arrangement of the Plates the order
 of numerical succession has not been regularly maintained. I trust that the Lists
 of the Plates and of the Individual Examples in a great measure will rectify any
 inconvenience that may arise from this circumstance. In the text I have habitually
 inserted a reference to the Plate in which each example is placed, except in the
 case of those examples that are printed with the text itself. Many of the Illustrations
 that I have obtained from monumental memorials, have been engraved by STOTHARD and
 others ; but I have not considered it necessary to refer to the Plates in those more
 costly and less accessible works, in which the Heraldry is subordinate to the monumental
 character of the subject represented ; and as, with rare exceptions, I have myself
 personally examined the originals, I have generally been enabled to rely upon my
 own notes and sketches for the fidelity of my examples. I feel sure that my additional
 examples from the grand old Abbey Church of St. Alban will continue to be regarded
 with the utmost interest, (Nos, 633, 690, and 711 to 717 inclusive). Plates XIX.
 and XXII I. have been lithographed again, since the publication of my First Edition,
 and the former Plate has been re-arranged. It will be understood that Ko. 364 A.,
 in Plate XXIII., has been drawn in exact conformity with the original shield. My
 chromo-lithograph, Plate VII., of the noble champlev&eactute; enamel shield of Earl
 William de Valence, has also been engraved, a second time, in order to render with
 exact accuracy the diaper upon the bars that are argent. I have elsewhere (see Chap.
 XXXIII.) noticed the publication of the fac-simile chromo-lithograph of this shield,
 of the full size of the original, after his own drawing, by Mr. L. Berrington, of
 Westminster Abbey.</p>

 <p data-source-line="366" data-source-file="duke.txt"> The publication of Mr. Seton's
 able and thoroughly heraldic treatise on the Heraldry of Scotland, confirms my belief
 that a feeling for Historical Heraldry is gradually extending its influence throughout
 this country. It will rest with those to cherish and to stimulate such a feeling,
 who have already learned to value Historical Heraldry because they have formed a
 just estimate of its true character. The " Herald and Genealogist," a periodical
 publication conducted with characteristic ability by Mr. John Gough Nichols, while
 it renders valuable aid to students of Heraldry, bears testimony to the prevalence
 of an interest in heraldic subjects. And I am persuaded that Dr. Papworth's excellent
 " Ordinary of Arms" only requires to be more widely known and more correctly understood,
 to be consistently appreciated, and consequently to be warmly supported.</p>
