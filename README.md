# OCR-Fixer
A scripting tool in Python to help correct and transform poor quality OCR texts 

## Why?

Repositories of scanned works, such as archive.org and Google books are fantastic resources, providing access to out of
print works in several different formats.  These include textual versions created through an optical character recognition 
(OCR) process -  however, the inevitable age and poor condition of some of the scanned works mean that the quality of the resulting text
can be quite poor with many incorrectly recognised words,  spurious markings and inconsistent layout. This can severely limit
their usefulness.

 often a first response can be to open the text file in our favourite editor and begin hacking away with global edits,
 spelling correctors and a great deal of hand editing. Whilst this may give a more useful and result it is essentially a
 "one-way function"...

OCR-Fixer  Is a tool...
