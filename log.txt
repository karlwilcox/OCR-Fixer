Condition * matches: purpose being not so much to lead students on to the applica-

Condition * matches: Heralds. In the following pages, accordingly, I have sought
Condition * matches: to define and elucidate the principles of Heraldry, to exemplify
Condition * matches: its practice, and to illustrate at once its utility and its attrac-
Condition * matches: tiveness. The Heraldry of the present time I have desired
Condition * matches: uniformly to exhibit as the direct descendant and the living

Condition * matches: This Volume does not profess to extend its range to legendary
Condition * matches: Heraldry, nor does it include even references to those fiftnciful
Condition * matches: and often fantastic speculations, in which the early Heralds

Condition * matches: peated references to standard works upon Heraldry I have con-
Condition * matches: sidered to be neither necessary nor desirable, but instead of
Condition * matches: this, I have prepared and inserted a complete list of heraldic
Condition * matches: authorities ; and, in the preparation of my pages I have been
Condition * matches: scrupulously careful that every statement contained in them
Condition * matches: should be based upon certain and approved authority.
Condition * matches:
Condition * matches: Historical Heraldry occupies a position of such importance
Condition * matches: in Histories of England, that a certain amount of heraldic
Condition * matches: knowledge has become indispensable to the student of English
Condition * matches: History.

Condition * matches: Heraldiy "alone can enable him to render his works, in the
Condition * matches: noblest and most perfect sense, historic moniunents. Without
Condition * matches: Heraldry, no lover of the great Art, which has been so happily
Condition * matches: revived amongst us, is able either to feel the full power of
Condition * matches: what the Gothic has transmitted to him from the olden time,
Condition * matches: or to realise all that it is now able to accomplish as a living
Condition * matches: art.

Condition 237 matches: aright the worth of archfleological accuracy, constantly re-
Condition * matches: aright the worth of archaeological accuracy, constantly re-
Condition * matches: quire that information which Heraldry is ever ready to
Condition * matches: impart.
Condition * matches:
Condition * matches: It is the same with Sculptors, when they treat of subjects
Condition * matches: that are derived from either medisBval or modem History,
Condition * matches: or that are in any way associated with Gothic Architec-
Condition * matches: ture.
Condition * matches:
Condition * matches: To Illuminators, Heraldry opens a wide and richly diversi-
Condition * matches: fied field of attractive study. The beautiful and deservedly
Condition 248 matches:
Condition * matches: popular Art of Illammation finds in Heraldry a most versatile
Condition * matches: and efficient confederate. True Illumination, indeed, is in its
Condition * matches: nature heraldic ; and true Heraldry provides for Illuminators
Condition * matches: the most appropriate, graphic and effective both of their sub-
Condition * matches: jects, and of the details and accessories of their practice.
Condition * matches:
Condition * matches: In some sense or degree also Heraldry enjoys the favour of
Condition * matches: the general public. To many persons, as to seal engravers and
Condition * matches: herald painters, it provides what may be styled a profession.
Condition * matches: Whoever has, or desires to have a " coat-of-arms," professes to
Condition * matches: know something about Heraldry ; that is, he is favourably dis-
Condition * matches: posed towards it, though perhaps he is unconscious of the
Condition * matches: sentiment. It is always pleasant to the pedestrian public,
Condition * matches: many of them bearers of time-honoured arms and having the
Condition * matches: reddest of red blood flowing in their veins, to be familiar with
Condition * matches: the heraldic blazonry that appears upon the panels of aristo-
Condition * matches: cratic carriages. Nor is it less satisfactory, when we chance
Condition * matches: to see a flag displayed and blowing out in the breeze, or when
Condition * matches: our eyes rest upon an heraldic seal, or when we discover a
Condition * matches: shield of arms in a book, or on a monument, or amidst the
Condition * matches: deconktive accessories of some building, to be able to read what
Condition * matches: Heraldiy thus has written with her peculiar symbols. And
Condition * matches: then, aja a matter of course. Heraldry, as of old, receives a
Condition * matches: becoming homage from the wealthy inheritors of historic names
Condition * matches: and noble titles ; while a similar homage is no less cordially
Condition * matches: tendered by those whose Heraldry, like their own position in
Condition * matches: the great world of society, is at least of comparatively recent
Condition * matches: growth.
Condition * matches:
Condition * matches: Prom each and all of these Friends of Heraldry, this Volume
Condition * matches: ventures to anticipate a welcome, inasmuch as it inspires to
Condition * matches: place before them, in a plain and simple form, whatever
Condition * matches: heraldic teaching they may require; and also because, as a
Condition * matches: book of reference, they will find it to be trustworthy, easy
Condition * matches: to be consulted, and, as far as it professes to go, complete.
